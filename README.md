# Deep Learning Embeddings for Optimal Assignment of Translation Tasks

Before executing code, disable `wandb` by typing `wandb disable` on the terminal.

All of the files need to be executed from inside their respective folders. The main file for the training loop resides on `model`, from inside there execute `python3 embedding_model.py`.

Another important file would be `model/create_dataset.py` which created the dataframe used by the pytorch model.

Some of the plots found in the report are created at `notebook/data_analysis.ipynb`. Most of them are from W&B.
