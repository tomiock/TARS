## Sampling for the dataset creation

### Large Dataset
- Make 25% train-eval split
- 1 out of 4 samples for eval data
- Eval data has equal representation across time

### Smaller Datasets
- Make 25% train-eval split
- 1 out of 4 samples for eval data
- Eval data has equal representation across time
- Divide training into equal chunks (e.g. 5)
- A model can be trained on each training chunk, to then compare to the whole eval. That way we can know which chunk of the historical data generalizes more.
- The chunks may be divided according to time (e.g. one chunk each 2 year/6 months).
